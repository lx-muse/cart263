    <h1>The "Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia" (STAV)</h1>

    <p>Beachler has described the late 1970s debate about the <span class="secret" id="1">character </span> of the Khmer Rouge. "Many of those who had been opponents of U.S. <span class="secret" id="2">military actions </span> in Vietnam and Cambodia feared that the tales of murder and deprivation under the Khmer Rouge regime <span class="redacted"> would validate the claims of those who had supported U.S. government actions aimed at halting the spread of communism. </span> Conservatives pointed to the actions of the Khmer Rouge as proof of the inherent evils of communism and evidence that the U.S. had been right to fight its long war against communists in Southeast Asia ... "[2]  </p>

    <p> <span class="redacted">Despite the eye-witness accounts by journalists prior to their expulsion during the first few days of Khmer Rouge rule, and the later testimony of refugees; </span> many academics in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia and other countries portrayed the Khmer Rouge favorably or at least were skeptical about the stories of Khmer Rouge atrocities. <span class="secret" id="3">None of them,</span> however, were allowed to visit Cambodia until the final few days of Khmer Rouge rule (except Gunnar Bergstrom, president of the SKFA) and few actually talked to the refugees whose stories they believed to be exaggerated or false.[8][9]   </p>

    <p>Some Western scholars believed that the Khmer Rouge would free Cambodia from <span class="secret" id="4"> colonialism,</span> capitalism, and the ravages of American bombing  and invasion during the Vietnam War. Cambodian scholar Sophal Ear has titled the pro-Khmer Rouge academics as the "Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia" (STAV). The STAV, which he said included among its adherents almost all Cambodian scholars in the Western world, "hoped for, more than anything,<span class="redacted"> a socialist success story with all the romantic ingredients of peasants, fighting imperialism, and revolution."[8] </span> Author William Shawcross was another critic of the STAV academics. Shawcross's views were endorsed and summarized by <span class="secret" id="5"> human rights activist </span> David Hawk: the West was indifferent to the atrocities taking place in Cambodia due to "the influence of anti-war academics on the American left who <span class="secret" id="6">obfuscated </span>Khmer Rouge behavior, denigrated the post-1975 refugee reports, and denounced the journalists who got those stories."[10]   </p>

    <p>The controversy concerning the Khmer Rouge intensified in February 1977 with the publication of excerpts from a book by John Barron and Anthony Paul in Reader's Digest magazine. Based on extensive <span class="secret" id="7">interviews </span>with Cambodian refugees in Thailand, <span class="redacted"> Barron and Paul estimated that, out of a total population of about 7 million people, 1.2 million Cambodians had died of starvation, over-work, or execution during less than two years of Khmer Rouge rule.[11] </span> Published about the same time was Fran√ßois Ponchaud's book, Cambodia: Year Zero. Ponchaud, a French priest, had lived in Cambodia and spoke Khmer. He also painted a picture of mass deaths caused by the Khmer Rouge. French scholar, Jean Lacouture, formerly a sympathizer of the Khmer Rouge, reviewed Ponchaud's book favorably in The New York Review of Books on March 31, 1977.[12] </p>
